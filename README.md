# Test Drive HCASE

We prepared a workflow that showcases how you can create an HCASE space and embed compounds into it that is available as `code/HCASE_Embedding_Parallel.ipynb` in the root of the HCASE repository. The workflows does not contain the visualization step, for that we refer you to `code/publication_workflows/HCASE_Experiments_Cherry_Picked_Scaffolds.ipynb` and `code/publication_workflows/HCASE_Experiments_KNN_in_HCASE_Space.ipynb` as starting points.

The `code/HCASE_Embedding_Parallel.ipynb` can be executed once completing the [**Prerequisites**](https://github.com/ncats/hcase/tree/feat_parallel#process-to-replicate-the-analysis-enclosed-in-the-hcase-manuscript) - [**Setting Up Conda Environment**](https://github.com/ncats/hcase/tree/feat_parallel?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-conda-environment) sections (see: below).


# For Contributors


We appreciate your contribution to the source code of the HCASE method! 

If you would like to create a new feature, or submit a fix, please follow this process. First, create a personal feature branch (e.g. `feature_new_1`) from the `feature` branch. Once your code is complete and tested OK on your end, please  create a pull-request (PR) from your feature branch to the `feature` branch of the HCASE repository. Approved features will be merged to the `main` branch.


# Process to Replicate the Analysis Enclosed in the HCASE Manuscript 



## Prerequisites


* *Git*

* Git *Large File Support (LFS)*

`git lfs install --skip-smudge`


* *Conda* environment manager for Python

See: [https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)




## Setting Up Repository

* Clone Repository

`git clone https://github.com/ncats/hcase`



* Pull Large Files

`cd hcase`

`git lfs pull` (this may take some time)


## Setting Up Conda Environment

`conda env create -f code/environment.yml`  (this step needs to be done only once, if you don't already have the *hcase* conda environment)

`conda activate hcase`  (this step is necessary everytime you want to run the HCASE method and/or the experiments)


## Post Publication Notes

For the sake of clarity, we moved all the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files into `code/publication_workflows` subdirectory after our paper got published. 


Before continuing with the rest of the instructions to reproduce the experiments, *copy* or *move* the entire content of `code/publication_workflows/` into `code/` (i.e. one level up in the filesystem).


## Execute All Experiments


`cd code/`

`bash reproduce_HCASE_experiments.sh`


## Alternatively, Executing Individual Steps


* Step 1: Create HCASE space using ChEMBL scaffolds

Run workflow in `HCASE_Embedding.ipynb` .




* Step 2: Embed approved drug molecules from DrugBank into HCASE ChEMBL Scaffold space, and visualize the kNNs (k=5) of select chemotypes. Additionally, this is compared to the position of the same select chemotypes and 25 randomly selected molecules. 

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_KNN_in_HCASE_Space.ipynb` .



* Step 3: HCASE Embedding of Cherry-Picked Scaffolds and their 50+50 Immediate Neighbors Based on Scaffold-Key Ordering

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_Cherry_Picked_Scaffolds.ipynb` .



* Step 4: Create the embedding of CANVASS molecules into HCASE ChEMBL space.

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_CANVASS_into_HCASE_ChEMBL.ipynb` .



* Step 5: Create the embedding of approved drug and CANVASS molecules into HCASE NatProd space.

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_Drugs_and_CANVASS_into_HCASE_NatProd.ipynb` .


* Step 6: Comparing HCASE ChEMBL and NatProd embeddings of approved drugs and CANVASS compounds

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_Compare_HCASE_ChEMBL_NatProd_Embeddings.ipynb` .



* Step 7: Quantify overlap of approved drugs and CANVASS compounds embeddings in HCASE ChEMBL and NatProd spaces

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_Quantify_Overlap.ipynb` .


* Step 8: Chebyshev Distance and Rank Distance Correlation.

Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_Chebyshev.ipynb` .


* Step 9: T-SNE Embedding of drugs and highlighting KNNs (k=5) of select molecules. Repeating the embedding and visualization on a reduced set (90%) of drugs.



Run workflow in `HCASE_Experiments_tSNE.ipynb` .



* Step 10: Creating an HCASE space using a reduced set (90%) of ChEMBL scaffolds, and the previously cherry-picked scaffolds. 

Run workflow `HCASE_Embedding_Reduced.ipynb` .



* Step 11: Creating the HCASE embedding of the cherry-picked scaffolds into the reduced HCASE ChEMBL space generated in the previous step.

Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_Cherry_Picked_Scaffolds_in_Reduced_HCASE_Space.ipynb` .



* Step 12: Repeating Step 2, only the KNN analysis of approved drug molecules is performed in a reduced HCASE ChEMBL scaffold space (90% subset of original ChEMBL scaffold used to create the HCASE space). So-called Not-NN neighbor analysis is not repeated, only the KNNs of the randomly selected 5 drug molecules.

Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_KNN_in_Reduced_HCASE_Space.ipynb` .


* Step 13: Perform embedding of cherry-picked scaffolds using the Altered t-SNE method into ChEMBL scaffold space. 


Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_Altered_tSNE_CherryPicked_Scaffolds.ipynb` .


* Step 14: Repeating the previous step (Step 13) utilizing the union of the 90% subset of the reference scaffolds and the Cherry-Picked scaffolds.

Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_Altered_tSNE_Reduced_HCASE_Space_CherryPicked_Scaffolds.ipynb` .



* Step 15: Embed approved drug molecules from DrugBank into Altered t-SNE ChEMBL Scaffold space, and visualize the kNNs (k=5) of select chemotypes. 

Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_Altered_tSNE_KNN.ipynb` .


* Step 16: Repeating Step 15, i.e. performing the Altered t-SNE embedding of the same 5 randomly selected drug molecules and their KNNs with the difference that a 90% reduced Altered t-SNE scaffold space is used for the embedding.

Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_Reduced_Altered_tSNE_KNN.ipynb` .

* Step 17: Aggregate embeddings.

Run workflow `HCASE_Experiments_Aggregate.ipynb` .
